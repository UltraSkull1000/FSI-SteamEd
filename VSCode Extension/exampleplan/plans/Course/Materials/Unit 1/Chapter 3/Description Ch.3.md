# Functions

Functions in Python are a form of abstraction.
Abstraction is when you hide the information on how something works. 

Functions are perfect for organizing your code and separating out individual tasks. This will make your code easier to read and understand in the long run! It also helps find tricky bug errors in our code because we can now find the functions where the issue is. 
Functions are a fun and flexible way to code and a requirement for more complex programs.
