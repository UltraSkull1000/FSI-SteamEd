    "1. **SyntaxError**: Syntax is the rules for writing code. Normally this means you are missing a colon : at the end of definitions or conditionals, or you are missing quotes \"\" or parentheses in the appropriate places. Double check your code to make sure none of this is missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IndentationError**: Remember that the content of a function always has to be indented in. Make sure you have a colon at the end of your function definition and press Enter for Python to automatically indent or tab over the necessary code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NameError**: Normally means you spelled something incorrectly. Double check the spelling of all your commands. Does your code say prnt instead of print? Or whiel instead of while? Correct those and you'll be good to go!"
