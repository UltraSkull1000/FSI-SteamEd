    "# Lesson 1.6: Dictionaries \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in python are exactly like dictionaries in real life!\n",
    "They store values in a key: value pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like dictionaries with the word: definition. \n",
    "The word is the key that you look up in the dictionary and the value is the definition that you find. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like dictionaries in real life, **duplicate values are not allowed** but the dictionary is **changeable** as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "How is this different than a list? \n",
    "No duplicates!\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing a dictionary:\n",
    "To set values in your dictionary, declare a variable and then assign it to {}. Within the brackets define your key: value pairs, separating each one with a comma. \n",
    "Keys can be strings or int's but in most cases it makes sense to have string keys. Values can also be any datatype. \n",
    "\n",
    "To define a dictionary follow this example:"

    "2. values() - returns a list of all the values in the dictionary\n",

    "4. update({key: value}) - adds the key: value pair to the dictionary\n",
    "5. pop(key) - removes the key: value pair connected to this key\n",
    "6. clear() - removes all elements from the dictionary\n",
    "7. copy() - returns a copy of the dictionary you can store in another variable \n",
    "8. len(dictionary_name) - returns number of key: value **pairs** in the dictionary"

    "2. Print the dictionary (Hint: you should be using two different methods, one to print the keys and the other to print the values)\n",
