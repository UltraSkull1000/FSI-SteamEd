# Conditionals and Loops

Now that we know the basics of data and variables in code, we are ready to dive into logic!

Logic is how we make decisions in code. This is really important for the coding of our rover and the final competition. We want the rover to do different tasks based on different conditions. 

Conditionals like if statements and loops make it easier to write out the logic for our rover. They are called conditionals because the logic is based on specific requirements we give the statements.
