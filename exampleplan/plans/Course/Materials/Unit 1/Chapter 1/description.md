# Data Types and Variables

Before we can get to coding rovers, we need to know the basics. 

Data is the basics to how we communicate to the computer. To tell the computer what to do, we have to pass it information in the form of an acceptable data type. Variables are helpful carriers in conveying that data to the computer. 

Imagine if you had to sing the entirety of your favorite song every time you wanted to mention it to someone. It might be fun at first but wouldn't it be quicker to say the name of the song instead? With just the name, you are able to convey information much faster. With these variables we can then implement really cool logic and organization within the computer!
